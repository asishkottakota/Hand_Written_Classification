# Hand_Written_Classification

Handwritten digit recognition is a challenging task for computers, as handwritten digits can vary widely in appearance from person to person and can be written in many different styles. However, it is a valuable task, as it has many potential applications, such as in automatic check processing, mail sorting, and document scanning.

This project will develop a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The model will be trained on the MNIST dataset, which is a popular dataset of handwritten digits. Once the model is trained, it will be evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its performance.

The project will be divided into the following phases:

Data preparation: The MNIST dataset will be downloaded and preprocessed. This may involve resizing the images, normalizing the pixel values, and splitting the data into training and test sets.
Model design and implementation: A deep learning model will be designed and implemented to classify the handwritten digits. The model may use a variety of layers, such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.
Model training: The model will be trained on the training set using a suitable optimizer and loss function.
Model evaluation: The model will be evaluated on the held-out test set to assess its performance.
Deployment: The trained model will be deployed to a production environment so that it can be used to classify handwritten digits in real-time.
The project will be completed using the Python programming language and the Keras deep learning library.

Expected outcomes:

A trained deep learning model that can classify handwritten digits from 0 to 9 with high accuracy.
